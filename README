Some scripts for bash.

monitor.sh
shows temperature for CPU and GPU (only for nvidia proprietary drivers), battery capacity and traffic speed per interfaces.
monitor.sh mostly scans /sys, but for GPU nvidia-smi is used.

fontpreview.sh
creates HTML file representing font family, path to font file and a sample text. It can use all fonts attended by fontconfig.
You need fontconfig intalled in your system.
Try fontpreview.sh -h to see how it's used.
